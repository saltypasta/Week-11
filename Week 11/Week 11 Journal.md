## Resonances

> "One might argue, borrowing  from political theorist Jane Bennett (2001), that archaeological and heritage sites have the power to enchant, and, in so doing, they stand as seedbeds for human generosity, ethical mindfulness, and care for the world at large"

+ Dr. Grahams Annotation: Can enchantment have negative connotations?
	+ My Opinion: Yes, absolutely. This resonated with the story I read early in the term about some of Dr. Grahams research into the trading of human bones via social media. The glorification of human remains as archaeological treasures to be traded is a perfect example, in my opinion, of how enchantment does not always inspire ethical practices. 

> As I interpret  this, emotion is enacted in the body, and it propels the body forward to act in some fashion,  whether that act is visible or invisible, physical or conceptual.

+ To me, the affective part of our work with the graveyards project pushed me to take less visible/physical action and to take more invisible/conceptual/reflective action. The emotions I felt after recording the gravestone of a young girl (Taylor Maria Adams 1999-2006) tapped into the same emotions I was experiencing from the loss of my 5 year old cousin only a couple weeks earlier. This connection propelled me to stop recording mindlessly, and reflect on the individuals I was recording and my own family. In regards to this prompt, I wonder if there is correlation between the type of emotion we feel and the kind of action it propels. I felt grief/sadness, and I leaned more towards conceptual action. If I felt anger, would that have lead to a physical action? What if I felt joy? Or more morbidly, schadenfreude? How the affective dimension of our work manifests is no doubt highly dependent on a variety of contextual factors such as personality, culture, methodology and more. I still wonder if there might be any observable trend between the types of emotions that enchantment engages with and the actions that result from said enchantment.
## Response to the Prompts
 >Discuss some ways in which a creative mindset might change what archaeology (or history for that matter) could be for you as a scholar.
 
 + While reading the article "Fire for Zeus: using virtual reality to explore meaning and experience at Mount Kasios" I recalled a trip I made to Kauai, Hawaii a few years back. I remember I had installed a virtual tour guide app that used GPS location to trigger audio files containing general info on the location we were passing through (The app I used and others can be found here: https://gypsyguide.com/). Often these little nuggets of information would talk about some of the history of Kauai, as well as the legend of how the islands were formed. This was an enchanting experience for me, as it augmented the reality of the landscape around me by contextualizing what I was seeing in real time. To take it a step further, I would be interested to see what could be done using VR (I would prefer to go back but I'll settle for a virtual version) to recreate Hawaii's history. As long as all the ethical dimensions are considered, I would love to see a VR depiction of the formation of the Islands from both a geographical/geological perspective (volcanoes going boom) as well as the mythical legend (Madame Pele making things go boom).
