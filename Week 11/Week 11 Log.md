# what I was trying to do

_Make a soundtrack using our data and maybe record the gravestones of some videogames I have_

+ [Week11](https://github.com/saltypasta/Week-11)

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_This exercise allows us to present our gravestone data in ways that are not just 'effective' but also 'affective' by leveraging creative tools_

## what I did

+ Sonification
	+ Opened the binder and was immediately lost at the prospect of using python. I gather this tool may be a bit beyond my scope at this point in my digital archaeology journey, however I understand the purpose is to convert our spreadsheet data into something meaningful to a piece of music editing software. I read through the annotations/pseudocode explaining each step but chose a different approach for the exercise itself.
	+ Opened [Two Tone](https://app.twotone.io/) and loaded in our graveyards data
		+ Adjusted the fields until I found a pattern of data that looked interesting. I decided to sort by height. 
		+ Considered using the filter slider to omit all entries that were "0mm" high and instead have a kind of meaningful gap between gravestone entries.... and then realized that 1. this is just a gap in recording and not the physical distance between stones (Though using the location data I would imagine something like that is possible) and 2. There are gravestones that are kind of 'inlaid' or 'flush' with the ground. Im guessing my fellow students would have logged these as '0mm' in height so I decided to keep them in. 
		+ I adjusted the sliders on the bottom to make the "song" a reasonable length and speed, and then exported to mp3.
		+ My [song!](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digiarch-lab-notebook-main&file=Week%2011%2Fgraveyards-data-height%20in%20A%20minor.mp3)
		+ Though its not something I would put on my ipod, I find it to be an affective way to imagine the difference in height of the stones. When you hear a high note after a low note, it strikes you differently but also similarly to looking at a tall gravestone after a short one. Taking this further I wonder if one could find patterns in the data between multiple fields, and then assign these fields their own instruments. I would imagine that patterns between fields has the potential to manifest musically satisfying patterns between instruments, even if it takes a bit of remixing
+ Archaeogaming
	+ Though I don't have access to my gaming consoles right now, I would like to #revisit this concept for my #consolidation document. I have Assassins Creed Odyssey (Set in ancient greece and published by Ubisoft) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (Set in 1899 U.S.A and published by Rockstar) and I would like to try recording a couple graves from each. It would be interesting to see how the graves from these very different periods are depicted in each game. 
	

## challenges 

_Very unfamiliar with Python still, however it would be worth learning to be able to convert the data we collected (or other data) into something I can "wrangle" in another program._

## thoughts on where to go next

_Play videogames and record the gravestones! Revisit some exercises and readings from earlier weeks in preparation for the consolidation document and exit ticket._
